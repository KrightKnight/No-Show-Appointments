Questions for Analysis
My questions for this dataset are split into two main areas of concern. How TIME and POPULATION play in this dataset.

- Were there patients who missed appointments?
- What was the distribution like for appointment waiting times?
- What areas had the shortest and longest wait times?
- Timeframes with the highest and lowest appointments?
- Is there a correlation between the waiting time and no-show ups?
- What gender was most likely to miss and of what age?
- Which area was hit headest by patients who didn't show up?
- Which areas had the most and least appointments?
- Did the patients who received an sms(es) more likely show up?
- What factors correlate?
